# ProjectForms2

A project using the tag forms and stylized with CSS.

This was my second project and challenged proposed by the Rocketseat (https://app.rocketseat.com.br) explorer course, where I had, with my knowledge to do a new project from the start, changing things from the last one, as instructed by the Figma project (https://www.figma.com/file/Nws1KWB7DyXBw8L6wXb9mp/Stage-03---Formul%C3%A1rio-intermedi%C3%A1rio/duplicate).
